description: Educational quiz app for "America's Toothfairy" presentations, which compares & measures before/after results, as well as long-term retention with a return-visit. Included unique sets of questions per age group, and in-app forms to handle school consent/details. A lot of work went into fine-tuning the UX for the quiz, making it extra-easy for kids (and adults) of all ages quickly breeze through the questions, and hand off to the next person.
