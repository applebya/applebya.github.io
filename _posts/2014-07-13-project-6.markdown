description: Developed a customized analytics module for the <a href="https://brili.com/">Brili mobile app</a>, enabling parents to track how long their kids spend on any given task over time. For example, to know that little Timmy is 5s faster at making his bed this month. I learned Angular for this project, and put a lot of effort into the data-crunching algorythms and mobile charting. Brili has <a href="https://brili.com/blog/2016/9/23/250k-grant-for-brili-in-schools" target="blank">since been funded</a>, yay!
