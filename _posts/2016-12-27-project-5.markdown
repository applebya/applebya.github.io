description: I was tasked to lead our company's first major festival campaign for Les Fêtes Gourmandes in Lasalle QC, a yearly 3-day food festival... right up my alley! <br><br>We prepared a full concept presentation, and proceeded to design & develop all of the signage, SMS, and web components for each attraction in the festival. Our signage funnelled people into the mobile campaign, provided a mobile guide, and notified them of scheduled deals & giveaways by SMS. The campaign captured a significant share of visitors, and made an impact on engagement and return visitors.
