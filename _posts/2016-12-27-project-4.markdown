description: Front-line sales tool, which streamlines the Quote -> Order process while in-store with a customer. The many (often unique) factors involved in calculating quotes for mats made this a fun challenge - and now they no longer have to do this manually :)<br><br>The app also included a multi-tiered user system, admin panels for fine-tuning prices/discounts panels, and few other handy features.
